"""Historical-fixture e2e: the failures that shaped the dev loop's policies,
replayed against the SHIPPED example pipeline (agent-engine/) —
a byte-identical copy per test, so state_dir, agents_dir and additional_files
resolve exactly as they would in a consumer's repo.

run_agent is stubbed (the SDK network boundary, via the fake_agents fixture);
files, git, checkpoints, verdict parsing and routing are all real. The
example no longer has a port_sweep step (the startup viz sweep and the
`kill_listeners` action are the remaining kill paths), so the
`_listening_pids` → `[]` patch is defense-in-depth — a contributor's real
process may be listening on the default viz port. Kill behavior itself is
covered in test_actions.py.
